PROJECT MANAGEMENT APPROACH

Software Process Model:
To take care of a real issue in an industry, programming engineer or a
group of engineers should coordinate with an improvement methodology that incorporate the interaction, techniques and devices ayer and conventional stages. This technique is of ten alluded to a cycle model or a product creating worldview.
Our project follows the waterfall model. The steps of waterfall model are:
•	Prerequisite Definition
•	Framework and Programming Plan
•	Execution
•	Joining and Framework Testing
•	Activity and Support

IMPLEMENTATION


To Develop Fitness Tracking Portal Website we used

Languages and Frameworks used: 
o	HTML- Hypertext Markup Language
o	CSS – Cascade Style Sheet
o	TypeScript
o	 Angular
o	Spring and Maven

 Angular

Angular is a popular open-source framework for building web applications. It is developed and maintained by Google and provides a comprehensive set of tools and libraries for building dynamic and scalable single-page applications (SPAs) and progressive web applications (PWAs).
Angular is built with TypeScript, a statically-typed superset of JavaScript. TypeScript brings strong typing, enhanced tooling, and object-oriented features to JavaScript, making it easier to write maintainable and error-free code. Angular leverages the power of TypeScript to provide a robust development experience.
 
Spring and Maven


The Spring Boot Maven Plugin provides Spring Boot support in Apache Maven. It allows you to package executable jar or war archives, run Spring Boot applications, generate build information and start your Spring Boot application prior to running integration tests It is a powerful and widely used open-source Java framework that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications. It was created to address common challenges in enterprise application development and offers a lightweight and flexible approach to building robust, scalable, and maintainable applicatio


 


USER INTERFACE


1.Login/Registration Page: The login interface allows registered users to securely authenticate themselves and gain access to their personal accounts. It typically consists of fields for entering the registered email address and password. The interface should include proper validation checks for accurate login credentials and provide error messages in case of invalid login attempts. Additionally, the login interface may include options for password recovery or account activation for new users who haven't verified their email addresses yet.

2. Dashboard/Overview Page: The portal's dashboard serves as the central hub where users can access an overview of their fitness data, including workout summaries, progress charts, upcoming goals, and reminders. It provides a snapshot of their fitness journey and allows them to navigate to different sections of the portal.

3. Workout History Page: The workout history page within our fitness tracking portal serves as a valuable tool for users to track and review their past workout sessions. It provides a centralized location where users can access detailed information about their exercise history, including dates, durations, exercise types, and additional notes. This feature enables users to monitor their progress, identify trends, and make informed decisions to improve their training routines. By leveraging the workout history page, users can set realistic goals, measure their performance, and gain insights that will guide them towards achieving their fitness objectives effectively.

4. Exercise Tracking Page: The interface provides users with a library or database of exercises categorized by muscle groups or workout types. Users can search for specific exercises or browse through different categories to select the exercises they want to track. This interface may include descriptions, images, and videos to assist users in understanding the proper form and technique for each exercise.

5. Goal Setting Page: The goal setting interface allows users to define their fitness objectives, such as weight loss, muscle gain, or endurance improvement. They can set 


specific targets, track their progress, and receive visual representations of their achievements. The interface may also provide guidance on setting realistic goals and offer suggestions for appropriate workouts and nutrition plans.

6. Workout Plan Creator: The workout plan page is a key component of our fitness tracking portal, designed to assist users in creating and managing personalized workout plans. This feature provides users with a structured platform to define their fitness goals, select suitable exercises, and establish a comprehensive training regimen. The workout plan page enables users to schedule workouts, set target durations, and specify exercise types and intensity levels. By offering this functionality, users can effectively organize their fitness routines, track their progress, and stay motivated. With the workout plan page, individuals can design customized workout plans tailored to their specific needs and work towards achieving their desired fitness outcomes.

7. Nutrition Recommendations Page: Based on the user's profile and goals, the interface calculates and presents macronutrient targets. It provides recommended ranges or specific values for macronutrients like carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. These targets may be adjustable to accommodate different dietary approaches (e.g., low-carb, high-protein) or individual preferences.
